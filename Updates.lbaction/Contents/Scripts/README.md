Custom actions are great, but difficult to keep up to date. Rather than all of us individually build updating mechanisms, and clutter our actions with update related UI and pinging.

[Action Updates User Information and Download](https://prenagha.github.io/launchbar/updates.html)

This action checks each custom action a user has installed and figures out if a newer version exists. It reports on results and provides options for user
* visit `/LBDescription/LBWebsiteURL`
* see `/LBDescription/LBChangelog`
* download `/LBDescription/LBDownloadURL` (trigger browser open URL)

The trick is for all custom actions to include the `/LBDescription/LBUpdateURL` key in their `Info.plist` as a string URL reference to a remote server of the `Info.plist` of most recent version

Also make sure the `CFBundleVersion` key is specified and uses standard version numbering convention `major[.minor][.patch]` where all 3 are integers.

*Optional* keys to enable changelog and download link features:
* `/LBDescription/LBChangelog` - string changelog text to display to user
* `/LBDescription/LBDownloadURL` - string URL reference to remote server where most recent action package can be downloaded

## Preferences
You may override/specify the Update URL for any action you have installed by setting a preference in this action's local preferences file 
`~/Library/Application Support/LaunchBar/Action Support/com.renaghan.launchbar.Updates/Preferences.plist`

You may also tell this action that a custom action should be skipped by setting the LBUpdate URL to `SKIP` in this action's local preferences file.

The action will search for custom actions in `~/Application Support/LaunchBar/Actions`. You may override this by setting a local `ActionsDir` preference.
